@strong{Part A - Codebase Preview}

@enumerate  

@item  Which Git command should you run to retrieve a copy of your individual repository for Pintos Task 0 in your local directory? 
(@dfn{Hint: be specific to this task and think about ease of use.}) 
(@b{1 mark})

@item Why is using the strcpy() function to copy strings usually a bad idea?
(@dfn{Hint: be sure to clearly identify the problem.}) 
(@b{1 mark})

@item If test @file{src/tests/devices/alarm-multiple} fails, where would you find its output and result logs? Provide both paths and file names.
(@dfn{Hint: you might want to run this test to find out.}) 
(@b{1 mark})

@item In Pintos, a thread is characterized by a struct and an execution stack. 

(a) What are the limitations on the size of these data structures? 

(b) Explain how this relates to stack overflow and how Pintos identifies it. 
(@b{2 marks})

@item Explain how thread scheduling in Pintos currently works in roughly 300 words. Include the chain of execution of function calls. 
(@dfn{Hint: we expect you to at least mention which functions participate in a context switch, how they interact, how and when the thread state is modified and the role of interrupts.})
(@b{6 marks})


@item In Pintos, what is the default length (in ticks and in seconds) of a scheduler time slice?
(@dfn{Hint: read the Task 0 documentation carefully.})
(@b{1 mark})

@item In Pintos, how would you print an unsigned 64 bit @code{int}? 
(Consider that you are working with C99). Don't forget to state any inclusions needed by your code.
(@b{2 marks})

@item Explain the property of @strong{reproducibility} and how the lack of reproducibility will affect debugging.
(@b{2 marks})

@item In Pintos, locks are implemented on top of semaphores. 

(a) Describe how the functions of a lock are related to those of a semaphore. 

(b) What extra property do locks have that semaphores do not?
(@b{2 marks})

@item Define what is meant by a @strong{race-condition}. Why is the test @code{if(x != null)} insufficient to prevent a segmentation fault from occurring on an attempted access to a structure through the pointer @code{x}?
(@dfn{Hint: you should assume that the pointer variable is correctly typed, that the structure was successfully initialised earlier in the program and that there are other threads running in parallel.})
(@b{2 marks})


@end enumerate

@strong{Part B - The Alarm Clock}

Reimplement @code{timer_sleep()}, defined in @file{devices/timer.c}.
(@b{30 marks})

Although a working implementation of @code{timer_sleep} is provided, it "busy waits", that is, it spins in a loop checking the current time and calling @code{thread_yield()} until enough time has gone by. 
You need to reimplement it to avoid busy waiting. 
Further instructions and hints can be found in the Pintos manual.

The marks for this question are awarded as follows:

Passing the automated tests (@b{8 marks}). 

Performance in the Code Review (@b{12 marks}). 

Answering the design questions below (@b{10 marks}). 

@itemize @w{}
@item @b{Data Structures}

A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `@code{struct}' or `@code{struct}' member, global or static variable, `@code{typedef}', or enumeration. Identify the purpose of each in roughly 25 words. (@b{2 marks})

@item @b{Algorithms}

A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to @code{timer_sleep()}, including the actions performed by the timer interrupt handler on each timer tick. (@b{2 marks})

A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in the timer interrupt handler? (@b{2 marks}) 

@item @b{Synchronization}

A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call @code{timer_sleep()} simultaneously? (@b{1 mark})

A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs during a call to @code{timer_sleep()}? (@b{1 mark})

@item @b{Rationale}

A6: Why did you choose this design?  
In what ways is it superior to another design you considered? (@b{2 marks})
